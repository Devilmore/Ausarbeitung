This thesis describes the implementation of a Path-planning algorithm for multi-axle vehicles using machine learning algorithms. For that purpose, a general overview over Genetic Algorithms is given and alternative machine learning algorithms are briefly explained. The software developed for this purpose is based on the EZSystem Simulation Software developed by the AG Echtzeitysteme at the University Koblenz-Landau and a path correction algorithm developed by Christian Schwarz, which is also detailed in this paper. This also includes a description of the vehicle used in these simulations. 
Genetic Algorithms as a solution for path-planning in complex scenarios is then evaluated based on the results of the developed simulation software and compared to alternative, non-machine learning solutions, which are also shortly presented.
