\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}

The program accompanying this work is written in C# and uses the OpenTK Library for OpenGL graphics. Several C# features such as functional and object-oriented programming have been employed, but as this program is not meant as a framework or teaching tool, no special importance has been placed on the usage of specific programming models. 
Originally the TAO OpenGL framework was used for the Graphics implementation, but this was later dropped due to the fact that most of TAO'S libraries are severely outdated and procuded several problems during map drawing. OpenTK has been chosen as an alternative due it's simplicity, stability and high flexibility. 
Visual Studio 2010 was used for development, other than OpenTK, which has to be installed seperately, only standard libraries were used.

\section{OpenTK}
\label{sec:opentk}

OpenTK is a free OpenGL library for .Net/Mono languages and is available across all Windows, Linux, Mac and other Unix-based Systems. It supports multi-monitor setups, a wide range of input devices as well as most GUI options. It also comes with integrated math toolkits for vectors, matrices etc. as well as type-safe bindings, automatic extension loading, error checking and inline documentation. OpenTK itself is also written in C#, but is compatible with all .Net/Mono languages\cite{36}.
