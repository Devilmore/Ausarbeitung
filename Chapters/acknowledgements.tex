A lot of people should be thanked for their patience with me taking my sweet time with this thesis, foremost of all Christian Schwarz for giving me so much time in the first place and my family for supporting me along the way. Also all the people working with me in other projects and groups who had to live with me taking so much time off of the project for my thesis.
